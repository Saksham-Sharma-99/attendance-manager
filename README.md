# attendance-manager
a python program that automatically helps automatically connect to a MS Teams meeting at scheduled time

all you have to do is add a csv file which contains your time table information.
keep following things in mind
1) column 'Class_Name' contains the name of your Team in MS Teams
2) coulmn 'Time' should be filled in the similar way as in the timeTable.csv file , i.e., HH:MM AM/PM-HH:MM AM/PM
